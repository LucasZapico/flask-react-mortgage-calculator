## Mortgage Math 

interest portion = outstanding principle * mortgage rate / 12
toward principle  = total payment - interest portion 

$$ 
payment = P * (r/n) * [(1 + r/n )^n(t)]/(1+r/n)^n(t)-1
$$

$$
P = L[C(1+C)N]/[(1+C)N-1]
$$

L = loan amount 
C = periodic interest rate (interest-rate/12)
N = number of payments (month in loan period)
